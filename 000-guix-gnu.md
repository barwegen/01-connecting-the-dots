## Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> if not running Guix Sysmtem (but install the guix on top of another system (as 'package-manager')) some additonal steps are necessary.

<sup><a id="fn.2" class="footnum" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> In the process, you’ve probably noticed that Guix downloaded pre-built binaries; or, if you explicitly chose to <span class="underline">not</span> use pre-built binaries, then probably Guix is still building software (\*note Substitutes::, for more info).
